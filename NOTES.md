* People submit their recipies for desserts and the app randomly choses one for you to make.

### Step 2: Working on the Overview

* List of recipes in each section and a randomizer(submit, get)
* A user can comment on a recipe (submit, post)
* A user can like a recipe (click, patch)

* A user can search their recipes (submit)

#### Step 4: Come up with an MVP
